<p><i>
Mass spectrum of localized states of quantum micro-objects is studied
in the framework of holistic (nonlocal) Heisenberg's scheme. As an object of a
fundamental level (potential reality), the quantum micro-object exists outside
of space-time. It is shown that state masses of lepton (except the neutrino)
and hadron sectors of matter spectrum are proportional to the rest mass of
electron with an accuracy of 0,41%.

<p><i>
Analytical representation of scheme is discussed in independent
Bernoulli trials by means of the ordered subsets of \(m\) (\(m < n\)) numbers of
successful and \(n - m\) numbers of failed tests. The probabilistic description of
\(P_{n}(m)\) is determined by summing the binomial formula \({p^{m}(1-p)^{n-m}}\) for all such
subsets rather than a simple multiplication by the number of combinations \(C_{n}^{m}\).
Some appropriate expressions are given for the probability of success with \(k > 2\) outcome of the experiments for the cases of equal and different probabilities of outcomes in different trials. In these symbolics, expressions for
calculating the corresponding probabilities of the number of successful tests
is specified in the presence of dependence of outcomes probabilities on a
parameter varying in time (from test to test), regularly or accidentally. Thus,
the basis is created for application of the scheme of dependent tests to
estimate the probabilistic characteristics of complex stochastic systems,
network architectures, in particular, characterized by some varying measure of
quality. In conclusion, we present the expression for the mathematical
expectation of the probability of m successful trials out of $n$ in the case of
random parameter on which the probabilities of outcomes depend. Hypothesis
about the possibility of using finite-dimensional characteristic function of
the random parameter in the corresponding expression for the case of
exponential dependence of the probability of the outcome from the random
parameter is written.
<br /><b>Keywords</b>: independent Bernoulli trials, ordered subsets of tests numbers,
dependent tests.

<p><i>
The integral convolution-type equations of the first
kind on the sphere are important for the geometric tomography.
They have been studied by many researchers. In this paper, we
consider the uniqueness and stability of solutions of such
equations. We prove the uniqueness of the solution for the
equation with the kernel of convolution type and obtain a formula for
the average value of a function on a subsphere. The latter is used
for the deriving of the inversion formula of Radon spherical
transformation on sphere. For the Blaschke-Levy equation and for
the convolution type singular integral equations of the linear
transfer theory, the uniqueness theorems are proved and find
estimates for the stability of solutions are found.
In all the cases we use the expansion of a function into series of spherical harmonics.
<br /><b>Keywords</b>: geometric tomography, convolution-type equations of
the first kind, uniqueness, stability, Radon spherical transform,
inversion formula, Blaschke-Levy equation, equation with a

Application of an Associative Rules Method to the Activities
Analysis of Public Organizations
</a></p> 
<p><i>
In the article the activities indicators analysis method of public
organizations is developed. The method of the associative rules is used.
Transactions are created of polling questionnaires. From coded responses of
questionnaires the associative rules are obtained. The rules possessing high support and
confidence are selected. On the basis of the associative rules the oriented weighted
correlations graph is constructed. On this graph search of communities is executed. The
selected community allowed to reveal activities factors of public organizations the most
tightly connected with each other.

<p><i>
The compactness of groups of patients with hypertension before and after
physiotherapy calculates by FRiS function. The ”defenses” of groups of patients is
determined by counting the number of nearest neighbors of each group of objects that
alternate FRiS function. The article offers a special FRiS function that improves the
accuracy of statistical estimates of the compactness of classes. As the result of the
calculations, it turned out that from the group of the patients ”after physical therapy”
a compact group is allocated, while the objects of the third part were not protected by
objects of the own group. From a medical point of view, it seems to be interpreted as a
positive effect of treatment for some patients.

<p><i>
Abstract. The results of analytical and numerical simulations of one-dimensional ideal
gas shockfree strong compression problem while compression piston’s radius is not
decrease are presented. The analytic formula for generalized compression Riemann wave’s
sound characteristics is the main result. Comparison of the formula with calculation of
the problem by characteristic method in time decreasing case is also presented. Obtained
formulas for sound characteristics was used to calculate gasdynamic characteristic
(velocity, density, etc.) of ideal gas layer while time increase. The computational
domain is the area between compression piston and the last sound characteristic of
generalized Riemann wave. The main results of numerical simulations are shown in
graphs and tables.

<br /><b>Keywords</b>: gas strong compression, the characteristic series method, solution feature.

Identification of a Parametric Model of Changes in the Number of Students Enrolled on a Small Sample</a></p> 
<p><i>
 A parametric model of changes in the number of students of the University
with a small sample is built. The number of high school graduates in the region
is taken as an input parameter. With the help of information criteria, the order of
autoregressive moving-average is selected. Applying the identification system feature
of Scilab, the forecast of the number of applicants for admission campaign in 2017
was made. A similar result was obtained through the identification of the model in
the form of the transfer function.

<p><i>
When we need to add several integers, computers add them one by
one, while we usually add them digit by digit: first, we add all
the lowest digits, then we add all next lowest digits, etc. Which
way is faster? Should we learn from computers or should we teach
computers to add several integers our way? 
In this paper, we show that the computer way is faster. This adds
one more example to the list of cases when computer-based
arithmetic algorithms are much more efficient than the algorithms
that we humans normally use.

<br /><b>Keywords</b>:  digits, adding, calculating

Modelling and Optimization of Allocation of Human Resources and Classroom University Fund on the Basis of the Curriculum Analysis</a></p> 
<p><i>
The main reasons for the need for a preliminary analysis of the initial data
for the calculation of teaching loads are presented. We confirmed the presence of factors
that affect the optimal distribution of the teaching load, such as a classroom university
fund, threading of groups and other. The study is based on the analysis and
subsequent optimization of the university curriculum. The curricula for the current
academic year of Kazakh University of Economy, Finance and International Trade
(Astana, Kazakhstan) were used as the initial data, as well as academic calendars and
rules for the organization of educational process on credit technology in the Republic of
Kazakhstan.

<p><i>
It has been recently shown that it is possible
to "cheat" many machine learning algorithms - i.e., to perform
minor modifications of the inputs that would lead to a wrong
classification. This feature can be used by adversaries to avoid
spam detection, to create a wrong identification allowing access
to classified information, etc. In this paper, we propose a
solution to this problem: namely, instead of applying the original
machine learning algorithm to the original inputs, we should first
perform a random modification of these inputs. Since machine
learning algorithms perform well on random data, such a random
modification ensures us that the algorithm will, with a high
probability, work correctly on the modified inputs. An additional
advantage of this idea is that it also provides an additional
privacy protection.
