<p><i>
This article presents a measure of similarity among finite sequences of
arbitrary nature elements. The measure uses number and quality of matches between
elements at the same positions as similarity criteria with priority to quality of the
match. Quality of the match is treated as maximization of matches between adjacent
elements. Examples of similarity measure calculations are adduced for a number
of match significance weight coefficients in m-adjacent
element positions (m-grams matches).

<br /><b> Keywords</b>: measure of similarity, finite sequences, m-grams, variations.

of the Infinitesimal SU(2,2)-Action
</a></p> 
<p><i>
Segal’s Chronometric Theory is based on the space-time D which can
be represented by a Lie group with a causal structure determined by an invariant
Lorentzian form on the Lie algebra u(2). Similarly, the space-time F is represented
by a Lie group with a causal structure determined by an invariant Lorentzian form on
the Lie algebra u(1, 1). The Lie groups G, GF are introduced as two representations
of SU(2, 2) which are conjugate via particular matrix W from Gl(4). Linear-fractional
G-action on D is global and conformal; it is instrumental in the analysis of space-time
bundles which is based on the parallelizing group U(2). The latter analysis was carried
out by Paneitz and Segal in 1980s. Linear-fractional GF-action on F (introduced by
Levichev in 2000s) is also conformal. Despite singularities of the latter action, the
group U(1, 1) can be chosen as the parallelizing one. In the paper we obtain tables
(similar to the ”Paneitz-Segal tables”) which are necessary in order to perform the
analysis of space-time bundles based on the parallelizing group U(1, 1).

<br /><b> Keywords</b>: parallelizations of space-time bundles, Segal’s cosmos, conformal group
SU(2, 2) actions on U(2) and on U(1, 1), DLF-theory.

<p><i>
In most applications, practitioners are interested in locating
global optima. In such applications, local optima that result from
some optimization algorithms are an unnecessary side effect. In
other words, in such applications, locating global optima is a
much more computationally complex problem than locating local
optima. In several practical applications, however, local optima
themselves are of interest. Somewhat surprisingly, it turned out
that in many such applications, locating all local optima is a
much more computationally complex problem than locating all global
optima. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for
this surprising empirical phenomenon.

A recent analysis of the productivity growth data

described by a Gaussian formula. In this paper, we provide a

<p><i>
To measure stiffness of the compacted pavement,
practitioners use the Compaction Meter Value (CMV); a ratio
between the amplitude for the first harmonic of the compactor's
acceleration and the amplitude corresponding to the vibration
frequency. Numerous experiments show that CMV is highly correlated
with the pavement stiffness, but as of now, there is no convincing
theoretical explanation for this correlation. In this paper, we
provide a possible theoretical explanation for the empirical
correlation. This explanation also explains why, the stiffer the
material, the more higher-order harmonics we observe.

<p><i>
In physics, the number of observed spatial dimensions (three) is usually taken as an empirical fact, 
without a deep theoretical explanation. In this paper, we provide a possible simple geometric explanation for the 3-D character of the proper space. We also provide a simple geometric explanation for the number of additional spatial dimensions that some physical theories use. Specifically, it is known that for some physical quantities, the 3-D space model with point-wise particles leads to meaningless infinities. To avoid these infinities, physicists have
proposed that particles are more adequately described not as 0-D points, but rather as 1-D strings or, more generally, as multi-D ``M-branes''. In the corresponding <em>M-theory</em>, proper space is 10-dimensional. We provide a possible geometric explanation for the 10-D character of the corresponding space.

<p><i>
Presented in the paper method, designed to directionally optimize the initial
conditions in problems of dynamic systems management, — a method of return — was
originally designed to optimize the vector of initial coordinates in a particular model
of moving objects conflict whose characteristics deteriorated as a result of interaction
with the objects of the opponent and aging. The model was binding characteristics (state
vector) and coordinates (control vector) of objects by Lanchester-type differential
equations. Then the specific problems of optimal control of the movements of a group of
objects, opposing another group of objects with the specified paths in the control
interval (by the criterion of minimizing a function of the final states of objects), were
set and solved. The problem of the construction of an acceptable on time and accuracy
algorithm to optimize the initial control vector, i.e. the initial placement of the group
of managed objects, was much more complicated. The found approach has been very general
and allows us to directionally optimize the initial control vector, at least in the
class of managed smooth systems with continuously differentiable quality functional. In
the most general form the idea of the method is that for optimization, in terms of
selected quality functional, of the initial conditions of the original optimal control
problem the supporting dual problem is written and the iterative process is implemented,
which steps alternate original and dual problems, and as part of the initial conditions
of the next iteration the part of the final values of the previous iteration is using.

the dynamic limits.

<p><i>
The problem of estimating the norm of the distance between the two closed
smooth curves for pattern recognition is considered. Diffeomorphic transformations of
curves based on the model of large deformations are described. For estimating of
the norm of the distance between two closed curves the functional, corresponding
normalized distance between the two curves, and the equation of diffeomorphic
transformations evolution are formed. An algorithm for solving the equation of
diffeomorphic transformation is proposed, built on the basis of PSO which can
significantly reduce the number of computing operations compared with gradient methods
for solving. The developed algorithms can be used in bioinformatics and biometrics
systems, classification of images and objects, machine vision systems, for pattern
recognition and object tracking systems.

increased agreement between experimental data after physiotherapy and structural model of

This paper examines the possibility of applying the analytic hierarchy
process, known in mathematics, in conjunction with the FOREL clustering algorithm
to classify different subjects. By term “conjunction” we mean a process when the
analytic hierarchy process (namely decision making under certainty) is used for
preparation of data for further work with them, and the clustering algorithm (taxonomy)
is used for direct processing of the data. The proposed approach can be divided
into two stages: the training stage and the work stage. We carried out a computer
simulation which verifies validity of the proposed approach
